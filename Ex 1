QUESTION 1

WP Rocket is using the rocket_clean_domain() function to clear the site's cache whenever that's necessary.
When an additional layer of cache is used, e.g. that of the hosting provider, that should be cleared in sync with WP Rocket's.
SuperHoster, a fictionary host, provides the purge_superhoster_cache() function to clear their cache.

Using the appropriate WP Rocket's hook, write a code snippet to clear SuperHoster's cache after WP Rocket's cache is cleared.
ANSWER

<?php
/**
 * Plugin Name: WP Rocket | Exclude Recaptcha from Defer JS
 * Description: Exclude Recaptcha from Defer JS
 * Plugin URI:  https://github.com/wp-media/wp-rocket-helpers/tree/master/static/wp-rocket-static-exclude-defer-js/
 * Author:      Ibrahim Nasir

namespace WP_Rocket\Helpers\static_files\exclude\defer_js;

// Standard plugin security, keep this line in place.
defined( 'ABSPATH' ) or die();

function exclude_files( $excluded_files = array() ) {

	$excluded_files[] = 'recaptcha/api.js';


	return $excluded_files;
}
add_filter( 'rocket_exclude_defer_js', __NAMESPACE__ . '\exclude_files' );

QUESTION 2
WP Rocket's Delay JavaScript Execution feature is used to lazily load scripts upon user interaction.
There are some exclusions added by default in WP Rocket's core, one of them being recaptcha/api.js.
A customer wants that script to be delayed, i.e. removed from the list of built-in exclusions. 
Using WP Rocket's respective filter, write a code snippet or a small plugin to remove that exclusion and allow the delay of the script.

ANSWER

// Clear the cache.
if ( function_exists( 'rocket_clean_domain' ) ) {
	rocket_clean_domain();
  purge_superhoster_cache();
	echo 'Both WP Rocket and Superhoster cache cleared';
}

QUESTION 3
WP Rocket is using the rocket_clean_post() function to clear a post's cache whenever that's necessary.
ANSWER

1. Which URLs are purged when that function runs?
//This function purges the cache of the post's permalink, as well as the cache of any archive pages that the post appears on (such as category or tag archive pages).
A customer reported an issue that requires you to debug that function. How would you log the URLs that are purged when rocket_clean_post() runs?

First, I will make sure both define( 'WP_DEBUG', true ); and define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true ); are set in the wp-config.php file.

Then I will add this code to the functions.php file of the website's active theme.

error_log( "Purged post URLs: " . print_r( $rocket_clean_post(), true ) );
